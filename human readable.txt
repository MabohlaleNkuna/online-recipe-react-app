Step-by-Step Planning for Online Recipe App

1. Project Setup
   - Create a New React Project:
     - Use the command `npx create-react-app online-recipe-app` to set up the React project.
   - Install Dependencies:
     - Install `react-router-dom` for routing with `npm install react-router-dom`.
     - Install `axios` for making HTTP requests with `npm install axios`.
     - Install `bcryptjs` for password encryption with `npm install bcryptjs`.
     - Install `json-server` to create a mock backend with `npm install json-server`.

2. Define Project Structure
   - Create Folders:
     - `src/components/` - For React components.
     - `src/pages/` - For page components.
     - `src/services/` - For API calls and utility functions.
     - `src/styles/` - For CSS or styling files.
   - Setup Routing:
     - Configure `App.js` to include routes for different pages using `react-router-dom`.

3. Design the User Interface
   - Create Wireframes:
     - Design wireframes for the Login Page, Registration Page, Home Page, and Profile Page.
   - Create a Moodboard:
     - Define colors, typography, and visual style for the app.

4. Implement User Management
   - Registration Page:
     - Create a form with fields for Name, Surname, Email, Username, and Password.
     - Use `bcryptjs` to hash passwords before sending them to the server.
   - Login Page:
     - Create a form with fields for Username and Password.
     - Use `bcryptjs` to compare hashed passwords for authentication.
   - Profile Page:
     - Allow users to view and update their profile information and credentials.
   - Protected Routing:
     - Implement route protection to restrict access to certain pages based on the user's authentication status.

5. Implement Recipe Management
   - Recipe List Page:
     - Display a list of recipes fetched from the JSON server.
     - Implement search functionality to filter recipes by name and category.
   - Add Recipe Page:
     - Create a form to add a new recipe with fields for Recipe Name, Ingredients, Instructions, Category, Preparation Time, Cooking Time, and Servings.
   - Edit Recipe Page:
     - Allow users to edit existing recipes.
   - Delete Recipe Functionality:
     - Implement a feature to delete recipes from the list.

6. Setup JSON Server
   - Create a `db.json` File:
     - Define initial data for users and recipes.
   - Configure JSON Server:
     - Add a script in `package.json` to start the JSON server: `"server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"`.

7. Connect Frontend and Backend
   - API Service:
     - Create API functions in `src/services/api.js` for GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH/PUT requests to interact with the JSON server.
   - Handle Data Fetching:
     - Use `axios` to fetch data from the JSON server and update the state in React components.

8. Implement Functionality
   - User Registration and Login:
     - Implement registration and login logic in `Login.js` and `Registration.js`.
   - Recipe Management:
     - Implement add, update, view, and delete functionalities in the respective components.

9. Styling and Responsiveness
   - Create Styles:
     - Add CSS or use a CSS-in-JS solution to style the app.
   - Ensure Responsiveness:
     - Test and adjust the layout for different screen sizes (320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px).

10. Testing and Debugging
    - Test Components:
      - Ensure all components are working as expected.
    - Debug Issues:
      - Fix any issues related to functionality or UI.

11. Documentation and Final Touches
    - Document the Project:
      - Write a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.
    - Push to GitHub:
      - Use GitHub for version control, create frequent commits, and push the project to a repository.

12. Deployment
    - Deploy the App:
      - Deploy the app to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify.
    - Submit GitHub Link:
      - Ensure the GitHub repository link is shared for submission.
